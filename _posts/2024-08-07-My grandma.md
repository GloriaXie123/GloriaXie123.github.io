My grandma

Looking at the photoes on the photo wall, I realized this woman, my grandma, she has such a strong will to live.

So many times I thought she will be defeated, but she didn't. This time, I don't know if it will be the end.

It's a sad story, at the end of the day, my grandma has to live on the children's mercy, the social care system is incomplete, even though 

she has a strong will to live, but the lack of the social care supported by the government is such a obstacle for people to live indepently.

The only thing I can do is to pray for her, pray the mercy will last until the end of her life.
