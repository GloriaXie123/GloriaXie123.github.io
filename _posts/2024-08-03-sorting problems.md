## Sorting problems

### The rules for sorting
We want to sort collections of data of different types, that means we want our algorithm to be general enough so we don't have to modify our algorithm for specific data type, that's why we need **callback**.

In java for all types of data we include **comparable** interface in their class method, all the **comparable** interface has to implement the **comapreTo** method.

the **compareTo** method has to follow several natural rules:

Antisymmetry;

transitivity;

totality;
