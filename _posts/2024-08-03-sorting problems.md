## Sorting problems

### The rules for sorting
We want to sort collections of data of different types, that means we want our algorithm to be general enough so we don't have to modify our algorithm for specific data type, that's why we need **callback**.

In java we implement **callback** by including **comparable** interface in each object's class, all the **comparable** interface has to implement the **comapreTo** method.

the **binary relation <=** has to satisfy:

Antisymmetry;

transitivity;

totality;

### Elementary sorting algorithm

1ï¼‰Selection sort, each selection round takes O(n) time complexity.

2) Insertion sort, move entries only once a time.

3) Shell sort, move entries more than one position at a time.
